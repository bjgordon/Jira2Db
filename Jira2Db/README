Jira 2 Db

---------------------------------------------

Pulls data from a Jira instance using the Rest API, and saves it to another 
database.
Allows the access of Jira data in a known stable format. Useful for if you're 
not comfortable relying reading Jira's database directly, or you are unable to 
get direct read access to the Jira database, but can expose the Rest API.
